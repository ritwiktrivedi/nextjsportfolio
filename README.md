# Tailwind CSS and Next.js Portfolio Website

I have used a template for creating a portfolio with Tailwind CSS and Next.js.

![Portfolio Demo](demo/demo.gif)

## How it works

Fork or download the repo and change whatever you need to change for your needs if you also want to change use the template. Make sure you also include
the MIT License of the original creator. 

Also make sure that you remove all of my personal info before using the template for your own use.

## Running Locally

Can run the application in VS Code or a terminal and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
